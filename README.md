Principles of Package Design is a book written by [Matthias Noback](https://matthiasnoback.nl/)

The book code examples are written in PHP and the tools that appears in it are from the PHP community.

## Goal of this repository

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/">
    <img
      alt="Node.js"
      src="https://nodejs.org/static/images/logo-light.svg"

    />
  </a>
</p>

I would like that people that works using Node.js could enjoy of the knowledge that this book offers to its readers. Therefore I going to use Node.js to write the code examples and I going to use tools typically related with it. :heart_eyes:

The style of the code and the chosen tools are 100% my decision. (The good and the bad parts! :kissing_closed_eyes:)

## How study the repository

1. For every chapter of the book has I created a directory
   where appears the final version of the code in the mentioned chapter.

2. Every commit has a reference to the chapter related. Any change I needed to do has a commit, with the objective of follow the flow of the book.

**Note**: If you want to open the links in another tab, just do a CTRL+click on the link.
