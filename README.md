I would like that people that works using Node.js could enjoy of the knowledge that this book offers to its readers. Therefore I going to use Node.js to write the code examples and I going to use tools typically related with it. :heart_eyes:

The style of the code and the chosen tools are 100% my decision. (The good and the bad parts! :kissing_closed_eyes:)

## How study the repository

1. For every chapter of the book has I created a directory
   where appears the final version of the code in the mentioned chapter.

2. Every commit has a reference to the chapter related. Any change I needed to do has a commit, with the objective of follow the flow of the book.
